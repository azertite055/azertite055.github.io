Hi!
This is the help text for Chesstris.

- Gameplay - 
All the pieces move as you would expect, pawns always move upwards.
The blue 'neutral' pieces can be controlled by both players, they can capture and be captued by both players and other neutral pieces, and can check both kings.
Spawning multiple kings is unsupported, and will lead to strange behavior.
Neutral kings are semi-supported, they move like any other king and cannot be captured directly, but they have no special gameplay behavior otherwise.
When a line is cleared, all pieces on the cleared tiles are also eraased. Kings can be exempted from this witha relevant game setting.
The speed values are in units of tiles per second. If speed is set to 0 (or less), picees will only move in response to keyboard input ("strategy mode")
If you have no moves but your king isn't under attack, play will resume with the other player dropping a block.

- How to lose? -
Checkmate: If you get into a position where your king has no safe place to move to, you lose.
Line clear: If a line clear destroys your king, you lose. This can cause a tie if both kings are destroyed at the same time.
Overflow: If you place a block above the top of the board, you lose.

- Settings -
The settigs are used for setting  the game's behavior.
In the preset menu, you can save/load setting profiles. 

- Online - 
A from of online play is available, through sharing codes. A sperate medium of communication with your opponent is required (to send codes). There is no matchmaking of any sort, just direct connections.
When hosting an online game, you can choose the rule from your saved presets, and it will be temporarily shared with your opponent; it will not be saved into their presets.
An online game can only start once all options are chosen. Once both players are ready, the game will start in a few seconds, this can still be cancelled if one of the players changes their ready state.
